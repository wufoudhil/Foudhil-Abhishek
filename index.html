            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Snowden's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>June 21, 1983:</strong> Edward Joseph Snowden is born in Elizabeth City, N.C. He spends his early life there before moving with his parents, Lonnie, a Coast Guard officer, and Elizabeth, known as Wendy, to Maryland.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>1991-1998:</strong> Snowden attends public schools in Anne Arundel County, south of Baltimore, before dropping out of high school in his sophomore year.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>1999-2001:</strong> During this period, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/us/for-snowden-a-life-of-ambition-despite-the-drifting.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">the New York Times reports, </a>he developed a fascination with computers and technology and socialized with a tight circle of friends who were similarly enamored of the Internet and Japanese anime culture. He also registered on the Ars Technica website, a hacking and technology forum, and over a two-year period posted as “The One True Hooha” or just “Hooha” about role-playing video games. After his parents’ divorce in 2001, Snowden lived with his mother in Ellicott City, Md.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>2002-2004:</strong> After attending a local community college off and on, Snowden passes a General Educational Development test to receive a high school equivalency credential. In March 2004, he enlists in an Army Reserve Special Forces training program to “fight to help free people from oppression” in Iraq, he later <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance">tells Britain’s Guardian newspaper</a>. But he says he broke his legs in a training accident, and Army records show he was discharged in September. He then lands a job as a security guard at the Center for Advanced Study of Language at the University of Maryland, which has a close relationship with the National Security Agency, according to the Times.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>2006:</strong> Snowden is hired by the CIA as a technical/IT expert and receives a top-secret clearance.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>2007-2009:</strong> Snowden is posted to Geneva, Switzerland, under diplomatic cover as an IT and cyber security expert for the CIA, a position that gives him access to a wide array of classified documents. He later tells <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance">the Guardian</a> that during this period he became disillusioned “about how my government functions and what its impact is in the world. I realized that I was part of something that was doing far more harm than good."</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Late 2009-March 2012:</strong> Snowden’s supervisor at the CIA placed a critical assessment of his behavior and work habits in his personnel file and voiced the suspicion that he had tried to “break into classified computer files to which he was not authorized to have access,” <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/us/cia-warning-on-snowden-in-09-said-to-slip-through-the-cracks.html?hp&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">the New York Times reports</a> after he is identified as the leaker, quoting two unnamed “senior American officials.” Snowden leaves the CIA soon after his supervisor’s criticism and begins work as a NSA contractor assigned by Dell -- one of 854,000 contractors with top-secret clearance working for the federal government. Over the next several years, he switches between assignments with the NSA and CIA for Dell, including a stint at a NSA facility in Japan that lasts until March 2012.</p>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>March 2012:</strong> Snowden moves to Hawaii to work at a NSA facility there as a Dell employee. He moves into a blue-and-white house in Waipahu, where he is joined by his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills, a 28-year-old performance artist. He donates $250 to the Republican presidential campaign of libertarian Ron Paul, campaign records show, followed by a second contribution of the same amount two months later.</p>
